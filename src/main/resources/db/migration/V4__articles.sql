        '1)	The Landscape
        Kyrgyzstan is a mountainous oasis in the desert steppes of Central Asia, enclosed by the celestial Tien-Shan Mountain ranges, with countless glaciers and lakes, from where water flows abundantly. It is not surprising that the country is popular amongst hikers. Many people call Kyrgyzstan as a “Second Switzerland” because of its wonderful and breathtaking scenery.
        2)	Fascinating cultures and traditions
        Kyrgyz culture is closely connected with nomadism in everyday life with holidays, crafts, music and cuisine. The nomadic life and livestock culture are based primarily on the animals and what tending and harvesting from them require during different seasons of the year. The harsh landscape and sparsely populated areas have grown a culture where quests were traditionally granted with the best of everything a host could provide and this generosity carries over to the modern-day travelers as well especially in the rural areas. For centuries Kyrgyz people have made many beautiful and fascinating things from sheep’s wool and animal skin.
        3)    Kyrgyz Cuisine
        Traditional Kyrgyz cuisine is a combination of ancient nomadic culture of the Kyrgyz people that borrows dishes and recipes from more than 80 cultures and nationalities living in Kyrgyzstan, as well as the neighbors, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and China. The lifestyle of the nomads included a constant movement from place to another alone the steppes and mountains both in cold and warm weather. Therefore, ancestors’ food was high in calories and very nutritious. These recipes have been passed down from generation to generation and are still a part of the Kyrgyz cuisine.
        4)	Over 2000 spectacular lakes
        In Kyrgyzstan, a country with untouched nature, there are about 2000 lakes, ranging from large to small. Each lake is unique and beautiful in its own way. Among the most popular lakes are Issyk-Kol – the pearl of Kyrgyzstan and Central Asia. Son-kol – it has a large selection of yurt camps. Sary Chelek – biosphere reserve in Jalal-Abad region, the flora and fauna of the reserve is very rich.
        5)	Hospitality of the nation
        The Kyrgyz people have been famous since ancient times for their openness, kindness, respect and hospitability. When it comes to the question “What is the main attraction of Kyrgyzstan?” it is not a building, monument or a specific place that comes to mind, but the legendary Kyrgyz hospitality. After all, it is in the blood of the Kyrgyz. Do not be surprised if during a trip through Kyrgyzstan, especially in rural areas, local people invite you for tea and treat you with different delicacies.
