        'The lake is located between the ridges of the Northern Tien Shan - Terskei Alaâ€“Too and Kyungei Ala-Too. There are two legends about Issyk-Kul. According to the first, due to a strong earthquake, one city completely sank underground, and the depression was filled with water. The girls who returned from gathering firewood found that their city was no more. They came to the lake every day and cried for their departed loved ones. There were so many tears that the lake became bitterly salty.

    According to the second version, one ruler fell in love with a beautiful girl and forcibly brought her to the palace. She could not accept the separation from her beloved shepherd and threw herself out of the window. At the same time, streams of water descended from the mountains, flooded the palace, and a lake was formed there. According to historical information, Issyk-Kul was first mentioned in the Chinese chronicles of the II century BC under the name of the Zhe-Hai (warm sea). The study of the lake began only in the XIX century. And in 2006, as part of archaeological research under the leadership of Vice-President of the Academy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan Vladimir Ploskikh, an ancient civilization that is at least 2.5 thousand years old was found at the bottom of Issyk-Kul.

    The ruins of an ancient Armenian monastery were also found in the waters of Issyk-Kul. According to legend, it is there that the relics of the apostle Matthew, a disciple of Christ, are located.

    Issyk-Kul stretches from west to east for 182 km, and from north to south for 58 km. The average depth is 278 meters, the largest reaches almost 700 meters. The water in the lake is blue and brackish.

    Issyk-Kul is a transparent lake. In winter you can see fish swimming at a depth of 47 meters, and in summer this figure is about 20 meters. The length of the coastline is 688 kilometers. The lake has several bays and coves, for example, Tyupsky, Pokrovsky, Rybachy and Dzhergalansky (Przhevalsky). There are many settlements on the coast of Issyk-Kul, each of which is worth to visit.',
