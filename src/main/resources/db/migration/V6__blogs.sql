        'Kel Suu is a mighty jewel in the crown of Kyrgyzstan''s lakes. It sits at an altitude of 3514 meters.I have travelled to this remote lake over 10 times now and every time I''ve been rewarded with a different view.The lake is at the mercy of so many elements. It was once even nearly empty on my first visit in 2018 (see last photo!).The place has such an ethereal energy and the groups I take here during my Adventure Tours in Kyrgyzstan have often compared it to scenes from Lord of Rings. Unfortunately, I never met Aragorn riding his horse here (wouldn''t mind going along if he offered me a ride üòè).Kel Suu is tucked between the Kakshaal Too mountain range and is pretty secluded. You also need a permit due to its location teetering with the border to China.It''s a 9km hike to get to the lake from the incredible Kok Kiya Valley and after the mini-trek, you can sit on the banks for hours to soak in the scenery (as long as it doesn''t rain, then you''ll be the one to get soaked üôà).',

        'This was the second hardest day of this 8-day trek. While my guide and I "only" had to hike 16km from the Jiptick Jailoo across the Jiptick Pass to the Darbazatash Valley, the total elevation was 1150m.                                                                  The final stretch to the pass was steep. The snow, ice and altitude didn''t make the ascent easier but - as everything else has been on this hike - totally worth the effort!!We were really lucky that we had a sunny day and such a clear view of the Pamir Mountains in the distance! We could even see Lenin Peak, one of Central Asia''s tallest mountains (7134m)!The descent into Darbazatash Valley was also lovely. We hiked for hours across the lush high pastures and mountain streams to arrive at the valley that was dotted with nomadic settlements.','REJECTED', '2022-07-01');

        'A couple of months ago, I was sharing a story about how I went on a 3-day horse trek in the Babash Ata Mountains near Arslanbob.I had added a photo of me and my guides and I was surprised to see how many women sent me a message asking if I felt safe. I was after all a few days alone in the mountains with these men and if something would happen, nobody would even know where to come looking for me...In all honesty, I never thought of this as an issue as I had never questioned my safety in Kyrgyzstan before.Yes, I often get approached by men asking if I''m married. But 9,8 times out of 10 it''s not because they''re after me.They just do this as this is such a commonly asked question in Kyrgyzstan. It''s a cultural thing and it''s also one of first things the women ask me (together with the question if I have children).I see it in the same way when we ask people we just met in Western countries what they do for a living...I also noticed that the men in Kyrgyzstan are curious. It''s quite unusual in the culture for a woman to travel alone or do adventurous things. They also see I''m foreign so what they really want to know is where I''m from, why I''m in Kyrgyzstan and if I like the country.They''re also quite shy as it''s not seen as appropriate to approach a woman when she''s by herself.The men - and in general the people in Kyrgyzstan - are in my experience gentle, friendly and kind. They respect women.You always have the odd duck, but that''s something you get in every place and country...There are a few things I do whenever and wherever I travel by myself and I added them in the comments (as it was too long for this caption).Just know that whenever I went into the mountains with only male Kyrgyz companions or guides, they cooked for me, they set up my tent, they pulled me up during steep climbs whenever I struggled, often asked me if I was ok and some even called me "chef"... I was really well-cared for!So yes, I''d say that it''s very safe - for both women as men - to travel in Kyrgyzstan!',
